# Instructions to Generate PWA Icons

The `generate-icons.html` file should have opened in your browser. If not, follow these steps:

## Manual Steps:

1. **Open the Icon Generator**
   - Navigate to the project folder
   - Double-click on `generate-icons.html` to open it in your browser
   - You should see two generated icons displayed

2. **Download the Icons**
   - Right-click on each image or use the download links
   - Save `icon-192.png` to the `public/` folder
   - Save `icon-512.png` to the `public/` folder

## Alternative: Use an Online Converter

If the HTML method doesn't work, you can:

1. Go to https://cloudconvert.com/svg-to-png
2. Upload `public/icon.svg`
3. Set output size to 192x192, download as `icon-192.png`
4. Repeat with 512x512 size, download as `icon-512.png`
5. Place both files in the `public/` folder

## Alternative: Use ImageMagick (if installed)

```bash
cd public
convert -background none -resize 192x192 icon.svg icon-192.png
convert -background none -resize 512x512 icon.svg icon-512.png
```

## Verify Icons

After generating the icons, verify they exist:
- `public/icon-192.png` (should be exactly 192x192 pixels)
- `public/icon-512.png` (should be exactly 512x512 pixels)

You can also use temporary placeholder icons for testing:
- The PWA will still work with just the SVG icon
- You can replace with proper PNG icons later
